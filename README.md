# Data Structure and Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive Python-based visualizer for fundamental **data structures** and **algorithms**. This project helps learners understand the inner workings of popular data structures and algorithmic concepts through step-by-step animations and an intuitive GUI.

## 🔍 Overview

The **Data Structure and Algorithm Visualizer** is built using `Tkinter` and `CustomTkinter` and offers real-time, animated visual representations of operations on data structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and arrays. It also includes algorithm visualizations for sorting and searching, accompanied by pseudocode for enhanced understanding.

Whether you're a **student**, **educator**, or **developer**, this tool is designed to make DSA concepts easy to grasp and engaging to explore.

## 🚀 Features

### 📦 Data Structures Visualized

- **Array**: Visualize creation, insertion, and updates dynamically.
- **String**: Manipulate and visualize string operations.
- **Stack**: Push/Pop with real-time stack layout.
- **Queue**: Enqueue/Dequeue with clear queue flow.
- **Circular Queue**: Circular representation of operations.
- **Linked List**: Insert, delete, and traverse nodes.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Visualize forward and backward traversal.
- **Binary Tree**: Build trees and animate traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder).
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Insert/delete/search with visual node highlighting.

### 🔍 Algorithms Visualized

#### Searching
- **Linear Search**
- **Binary Search**

#### Sorting
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Radix Sort**

### 🖥️ GUI Features

- Interactive input: comma-separated integers or randomly generated arrays.
- Playback controls: Play, Pause, Next Step, Previous Step.
- Reset visualizations for repeated practice.
- Display pseudocode/images during animations.
- Scrollable canvas for large visualizations (e.g., trees).

### ⚠️ Error Handling

- Input validation (e.g., non-negative integers, input size limits).
- Edge case handling (e.g., queue overflow/underflow, duplicate BST values).
- User-friendly error messages via `messagebox`.

### 🎨 Visual Enhancements

- Color-coded elements to represent states (active node, comparison, pivot, etc.).
- Smooth transitions and animations.
- Custom layouts (e.g., circular layout for circular queue).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core logic and backend.
- **Tkinter / CustomTkinter**: GUI framework.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Render pseudocode and diagram images.
- **Math Module**: For layout calculations (e.g., circular queue).
- **Collections (deque)**: Efficient data structure handling.
